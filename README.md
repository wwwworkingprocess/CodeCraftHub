# CodeCraftHub – User Management Service

## Overview

CodeCraftHub is a capstone project developed as part of the  
**IBM – Generative AI: Elevate your Software Development Career** course.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how **Generative AI can be
effectively integrated into every stage of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**,
from requirements gathering to deployment.

This repository contains the **User Management Service**, implemented as a
microservice using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

---

## Project Goals

- Design and build a backend microservice using **AI-assisted development**
- Apply **Generative AI at every phase of the SDLC**
- Follow a **microservices-based architecture**
- Implement CRUD operations for user management
- Containerize and deploy the service using Docker
- Maintain a clear and incremental Git commit history

---

## Architecture Overview

- **Backend Framework:** Node.js with Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB (via Mongoose ODM)  
- **Architecture Style:** Microservices  
- **Containerization:** Docker

## AI-Assisted Development Phases

Each phase below corresponds to a guided lab task and demonstrates the use of
Generative AI to assist decision-making, design, and implementation.

### 1. Gathering Requirements for the Development of the Learning Platform
- Used Generative AI to identify functional and non-functional requirements
- Defined the scope and responsibilities of the User Management Service

### 2. Choosing the Architecture and Components
- Used AI to recommend a microservices-based backend architecture
- Selected Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB as core technologies

### 3. Create the User Service
- Designed the User entity and data model using AI guidance
- Defined service responsibilities and API scope

### 4. Insert Code into Each File
- Generated boilerplate and business logic using AI-assisted prompts
- Implemented CRUD endpoints for user management

### 5. Test the Application
- Used Generative AI to create test cases for API endpoints
- Validated functionality and data persistence

### 6. Code Review
- Performed AI-assisted code review for quality and best practices
- Improved readability, structure, and maintainability

### 7. Documentation
- Generated and refined documentation with AI assistance
- Ensured clarity and alignment with project objectives

### 8. Dockerfile
- Used AI to generate a Dockerfile for containerization
- Built and ran the service inside a Docker container

## Summary

This project showcases how Generative AI can be embedded into the full
development lifecycle, not only for code generation, but also for planning,
design, testing, review, and documentation.

The commit history of this repository reflects a **step-by-step,
AI-assisted development process** aligned with the course objectives.
